# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Notebooks Collection

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** (and in some cases **Feature Engineering**) across different real-world datasets.

## Contents

| Notebook | Dataset file(s) referenced in notebook | What it covers (high-level) |
|---|---|---|
| `EDA and FE Flight price prediction.ipynb`  | EDA + feature engineering workflow for flight-price prediction; categorical encoding and visualizations. |
